# P0: RankeDB — The Data Structure

*Notes for the formal definition paper. P0 defines the abstract data structure and its invariants. No implementation details, no stack choices, no code.*

---

## Scope

P0 is the theoretical foundation. It defines:
- The graph as an abstract data structure (nodes, edges, three regions)
- Content type taxonomy and encoding scheme
- Formal invariants
- Merkle-DAG property with proofs
- Snapshot hashchain
- Philosophical grounding (provenance ≠ consensus, bounded scope, attributed claims)

P0 does NOT cover: Postgres, S3, FalkorDB, Docker, API design, worker implementations, branching, caching. Those belong in P1 (implementation).

## Formal Results

### 1. DAG property under circular semantics

Let G = (V, E_in ∪ E_out) be the graph. Every edge e has a parent (the node that created it) and a target (the node it points to). Edges are created atomically with their parent node.

- **Input edge (direction = in):** "my parent was derived from target." Provenance.
- **Output edge (direction = out):** "my parent asserts something about target." Semantics.

Define the provenance subgraph G_p = (V, E_in).

**Theorem:** G_p is acyclic.

**Proof:** Every node v has a creation time t(v). Input edges can only target nodes that existed before v was created: for every edge (u, v) ∈ E_in where v is the parent, t(target(e)) < t(v). This establishes a strict partial order on V by creation time. A strict partial order admits no cycles. ∎

Output edges are not subject to this constraint — they can target any existing node, including "older" neighbors. Therefore G may contain cycles (through output edges), but G_p cannot.

**Corollary:** The provenance subgraph G_p is always a DAG, regardless of the semantic richness of output edges. Circular semantics (A knows B, B knows A) are modeled by two separate relation nodes, each with output edges, but the provenance subgraph (input edges only) remains acyclic.

### 2. Merkle integrity

Every ID in the system is a cryptographic hash H.

Edge hash:
```
h(e) = H(parent(e) ‖ target(e) ‖ type(e) ‖ direction(e))
```

Node hash:
```
h(v) = H(content_hash(v) ‖ content_type(v) ‖ encoding(v) ‖ h(e₁) ‖ ... ‖ h(eₙ) ‖ created_at(v) ‖ worker_id(v))
```

where e₁...eₙ are all edges (input and output) created with v.

**Theorem:** Manipulation of any node v' in the provenance subgraph of v changes h(v).

**Proof:** By induction on the depth of the DAG.

*Base case:* v' = v. Changing any field of v changes h(v) directly (H is collision-resistant). ✓

*Inductive step:* v' is an ancestor of v in G_p. There exists a path v' → ... → u → v in G_p (following input edges). By inductive hypothesis, manipulation of v' changes h(u). h(u) is the target hash used in the computation of some input edge e of v. Changing h(u) changes h(e). Changing h(e) changes h(v) (since h(e) is part of v's hash computation and H is collision-resistant). ∎

**Corollary:** Each node hash witnesses the integrity of its entire provenance subgraph. Tampering anywhere below is detectable at the root.

### 3. Content-addressing and idempotency

**Theorem:** Identical content with identical provenance produces identical node hashes.

∀ v₁, v₂: fields(v₁) = fields(v₂) → h(v₁) = h(v₂)

Since node ID = node hash, identical nodes are the same node. Writes are idempotent by construction. Deduplication is free.

### 4. Snapshot hashchain

Snapshots are special nodes whose inputs are all current heads (nodes with no children in G_p) plus the previous snapshot.

```
s₀ = H(heads(G_p, t₀))
sₙ = H(heads(G_p, tₙ) ‖ sₙ₋₁)
```

The snapshot sequence (s₀, s₁, ..., sₙ) is a hashchain. Each snapshot witnesses the graph state AND all previous snapshots. Manipulation of any sᵢ invalidates all sⱼ for j > i.

Snapshot hashes can be published to any external timestamping service — e.g. in the New York Times or a public ledger (Haber & Stornetta, 1991) — to provide third-party proof of graph state at a given point in time.

## Edge Structure

Every edge belongs to exactly one node: the node that created it (its parent).

```
edge = {
  parent:     hash_of_creating_node,
  target:     hash_of_target_node,
  type:       relation_type,
  direction:  in | out
}
```

- **Input edge (in):** parent is the new node, target is an older node that contributed to the parent's creation. Provenance direction.
- **Output edge (out):** parent is the new node, target is an older node that the parent asserts something about. Semantic direction.

The direction flag is what separates the provenance subgraph (acyclic, Merkle-secured) from the semantic layer (potentially cyclic, expressive). Both coexist in the same graph. Both are immutable once created. Both are hashed into the parent node's ID.

---

## Node Creation is Atomic

A node and all its edges are created in a single atomic transaction:
- n input edges (provenance: sources and derivations)
- m output edges (semantics: relations asserted)
- 1 content blob (the payload, stored separately, referenced by content_hash)
- 1 worker attribution

Nothing can be added to a node after creation. No edge can be added later. The node's hash covers everything it will ever have. This is what makes the Merkle property hold: h(v) is final at creation time.

---

## Hash Function Agnosticism

P0 uses H(x) to denote the cryptographic hash function, not a specific algorithm. The reference implementation (P1) specifies the concrete choice (e.g. SHA-256). The architecture allows:
- Hash type prefix on IDs: `sha256:a3f2b7c...`
- Coexistence of different hash functions during migration
- Future migration to post-quantum hash functions

Reference: Haber & Stornetta (1991), "How to Time-Stamp a Digital Document" — the foundational paper on cryptographic timestamping. They demonstrated the concept by publishing hash digests in the New York Times.

## Auth-Scoped Visibility and Merkle Compatibility

Auth-scoped visibility (a node derived from a confidential source is automatically confidential) is compatible with the Merkle-DAG.

A user receives a verifiable subgraph: full nodes with content for everything in scope. For branches outside their scope, they see only the hash — enough to verify the integrity of their own subgraph, but no content access.

```
[hash_only] ← confidential node, user sees only hash
     ↓
[full node] ← derived, user has access
     ↓
[full node] ← user has access
```

The user can verify: "my subgraph is intact, it builds on a node with hash X whose content I don't know." Integrity is provable without transparency. Only the server sees everything.

Merkle structure is what *enables* verifiable partial views. Auth scoping and Merkle integrity are complementary.

## Content Type Taxonomy

(Defined in detail in the current paper 1 §2.1 and §2.2. To be moved to P0.)

Three-part identifier: `content_type` + `encoding`.

- `content_type` = `category/type` (RankeDB-defined categories, application-extendable types)
- `encoding` = MIME-style `class/format` (application-defined, cache policy falls out of class prefix)

### Source types (Level 0)
- `source/conversation` — communicative act with sender/receiver
- `source/media` — perceptual capture, content opaque until processed
- `source/record` — machine/objective observation of world-state
- `source/data` — structured information (defined by exclusion)
- `source/bulk` — container of other sources

### Derivation types (Level 1 — the cognitive layer)
Every L1 node is a thought — the output of a worker interpreting the graph.

**Resolved forms:** `conversation/*`, `image/*`, `video/*`
**Cognitive derivations:** `classification/*`, `observation/*`, `summary/*`, `fact/*`

### Encoding
MIME-style: `text/eml`, `image/png`, `audio/wav`, `application/pdf`.
- `text/*` → eligible for inline caching (P1 implementation detail)
- Everything else → binary, stored in content-addressed blob store only

### Design principle
*Few types, many encodings.* The diversity of the world lives in encodings, not in the type system. Each encoding is a micro-project: a parser.

## Philosophical Grounding

(Quotes and design notes collected in papers/01-rankedb/quotes.md. Key points for P0:)

### Provenance and consensus are orthogonal problems
- **Provenance** = attribution (who said what, when, on what basis). Solvable by construction.
- **Consensus** = social agreement on what to trust. Human process, not database architecture.
- RankeDB handles provenance. Consensus is downstream, built by consumers on top.

### Bounded scope: personal to small-enterprise
- At bounded scale, trust is pre-established, ontology is finite, adversarial resistance is simple.
- RankeDB does not aim for Wikipedia-scale global consensus.

### Thesis
**RankeDB stores attributed claims; common truth is what consumers build on top when they want it.**

## Part I voice pass — deferred

Direction (2026-05-03): philosophy in Part I should *carry, not bore — a ride, not a dusty lecture*. Apply once Parts II and III are stable. Voice tactics live in `~/.claude/projects/-Users-flo-Developer-ranke-ranke-graph/memory/feedback_part1_voice.md`.

**Already carries — preserve the rhythm:**

- §1 (three statements) — the model.
- §3.1 *"Provenance is not an annotation on the knowledge — it _is_ the knowledge."*
- §3.2 *"Contradiction is not a bug to resolve, it is a fact about the evidence base. Resolving it destroys information."*
- §3.5 Thesis line.

**Currently lectures — passages to revise, in order of payoff:**

1. **§2.4 Convergence** — three sentences of transition prose with no image and no claim that hasn't been made. Either cut, or rewrite as a punchline closing §2 and let §2.3 hand off straight to §3.
2. **§2.2 The CS Priority That Was Never Operationalised** — currently a literature dump of "system X does A but not B" clauses. Convert to one rhetorical paragraph (name the pattern, deliver the killer line) and migrate the named-systems list to §10 (Related Work) where it belongs anyway.
3. **§2.3 The Rupture** — opens with "Knowledge management systems face a fundamental tension" (textbook). Lead with the rupture itself: machines reading and writing at human scale, the systems we built were sized for a reader who would never see most of the data. Then the existing LLM/PROV-DM material follows with momentum.
4. **§3.1 first paragraph** — long bullets explaining "everything is knowledge" before the killer line. Reorder so the killer line *leads*, bullets become illustration.
5. **§2.1 Archival Tradition** — solid; small trim only. Remove "rightly" from "rightly criticised" — sounds like hedging.

**Pieces to leave alone:** §2.1 (apart from the trim), §3.3 / §3.4 (still `#todo[]` bullets — write fresh in the new voice when we get there).

## Repo strategy (2026-05-04)

Three repos planned (URLs known):

- **`ranke-go`** — reference implementation of the ADT in Go, in-memory only, no persistence. Imports nothing project-specific. → `github.com/flocko-motion/ranke-go`
- **`ranke-py`** — reference implementation of the ADT in Python, independent of `ranke-go`. Same conformance suite, same expected hashes. → `github.com/flocko-motion/ranke-py`
- **`ranke-db`** — persistence + query layer (subject of paper P2). Imports the ADT (from `ranke-go` or its own equivalent); exposes reads as Ranke-Graph-typed subgraphs and writes as Ranke-Graph-typed insertions. → `github.com/flocko-motion/ranke-db`

Why Go and Python: Go for performance + modern build, Python for the AI/LLM toolchain ecosystem. Two languages exercise the spec from different angles; agreement on hashes between independent implementations is a strong correctness signal.

Conformance test data lives in `01-ranke-graph/testdata/` in this paper repo (mock placeholders today; populated by the reference implementations once they exist). YAML for the operations file (readable, supports comments). The paper itself does not commit to a format — the `testdata/README.md` says "format follows the reference implementation."

## Meta-principle: qualities, not commitments (2026-05-04)

P1's role versus the reference implementations:

- **P1 defines required *qualities*** — what canonical encoding must do, what a hash-id mechanism must satisfy, what the four set operations must produce. Phrased timelessly. Ages well.
- **Reference implementations make specific *choices*** that satisfy those qualities — CBOR Deterministic for encoding, IPFS multihash for hash ids, YAML for the test format, Go and Python as the languages.
- **The paper names the choices as "e.g." pointers, not as commitments.** "Any encoding satisfying these qualities is acceptable; CBOR Deterministic is one well-known example, and the reference implementations adopt it."

Three sentences, three commitment levels: *required quality* → *example satisfier* → *reference choice*. Keep that structure whenever introducing an implementation-shaped concern in P1.

When reviewing prose: every "we use X" or "we adopt Y" inside P1 should be either (a) about a structural rule that genuinely commits the ADT, or (b) reframed into the qualities-plus-example pattern. Don't let specific design choices sneak into P1 as if they were ADT requirements.
